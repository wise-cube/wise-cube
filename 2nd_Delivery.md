###Comments that you received during the 1st delivery and how you have addressed them

###Changes made to your design, architecture and evaluation plan 

##### Design
After analysed the comment received during the presentation and the user advices we have decide to integrate
a museum guide into out system, in this way the users can use the device to play a game and have a guided tour
using the same device. In the museum the user will find tow different type of activator: one for the game and one for the guide.
Moreover, under a user suggestion, we have decide to create a specific tour experience aimed at kids and
relace the cube with a smaller e more portable object that have only one display to visualize the Qr code.

#####Architecture

######Work in progress

#####Evluation plan 

The evaluation plan is the following:

- [X] Brainstorming with design advisor
- [X] Mockup
- [X] Evaluation 1
- [ ] **Prototyping**
- [ ] Evaluation 2
- [ ] Product Development
- [ ] Evaluation 3 (feedback)

For now we have evaluate only the general idea and the mockup, the next steps are the evaluation of the prototype
and the final product under a technical and user point of view.

###Presentation of the evaluation conducted since the 1st delivery.

The evaluation conducted since the first delivery has been done through this [Google form](https://forms.gle/j8imT1uCAk1TxU6y6).
The form has been submited from different type of user, from 17 60 year old with different education level and works.
 
From the form the larger part of the user go to the museum 3-5 times in a year, and have done at least one time a 
interactive tour.

The result of the questionnaire show that in the user opinion this type of activity can be done by everyone, but 
with a differentation of the tour, and more than 90% of the user think that this activity can support the user learning.

The large part of the users are willing to hold the cube during the tour, but using a smallest device 
they will be more interest.


###List of what you expect to evaluate till the 3rd and final delivery
 
After complete the prototype we have plan to evaluate game web app and guide web app in therms of
usability, interaction and difficulty level using a new Google form.
We will evaluate also some technical aspects the latency and the responsivness of the system using statistic data.

The last evaluation will be done after che creation of all system, as the previous one using the form for the user 
experience and stastistics for the technical aspects.

###Presentation of the technical work done since the 1st delivery

Since the first delivery we have develop the database and the relative query to store the quiz and guide iformation, and the data required 
to manage the system.
We have also develop a QR code generator to access in the guide and in the game, and also the web application.
