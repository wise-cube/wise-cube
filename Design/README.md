## Introduction

In this document we're concerned about the design aspects of the IoT system proposed for the big project presented for the elective in Internet of Things at "La Sapienza University of Rome".

The aim of the project, developed in co-operation with the ***Museum of Classical Arts*** of Sapienza University, is to improve the user experience during the tour, offering information with innovative techniques and a different kind of entertainment.

## Product

###### Description

The IoT device, provided by the museum, is an interactive, multi-functional cube composed by LED displays.

The cube contains inside an ***ST-Microelectronics Nucleo board***, a NFC module to communicate with other sensors placed inside the many rooms of the museum. 

We took inspiration from the Rubik's cube to develop the shape of the device and to mimic the handling, to give the users something comfortable to use.

###### User experience

Our product offers a funny and Interactive user experience, suited either for a single user, or for multiple users together. Single visitors can even find other participants to play with, so to challenge them and even socialise.

Once arrived at the museum, the users are prompted to use ***the cube***, to start this new tour experience and to play a game with the artworks, otherwise they can go on taking the classical tour. 

If the users decides to take the alternative tour with the cube, the museum staff will provide the few instructions to use it.

Wise-cube provides even an __interactive tour__, which the users can decide to choose, based on the age of the participants.
The cube offers a dedicated tour experience for the kids, presenting a more simplified and enjoyable journey with respect to didactics, and their educational level and a regular tour for everyone.

When the users start their tour through the rooms of the museum, they will discover the ___cube activators___ where to place the cube near the artworks and the cube will display the corresponding QR-code to start the journey through the museum guided by the __cube__ and playing the game level, depending on the answer the player can receive an explanation or a curiosity on the artworks.

Once the users have completed the visit at the museum, they have completed also all the game levels and at the end the user who have gained the highest score wins the game.
